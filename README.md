# LabVIEW Experiments

## Overview
This repository contains LabVIEW experiments designed to introduce and develop skills in Virtual Instrumentation (VI), modular programming, arithmetic and logical operations, and loop-based computations. The experiments demonstrate practical applications of LabVIEW, emphasizing graphical programming, dataflow concepts, and the creation of subVIs.

## Objectives
- Understand the principles of Virtual Instrumentation
- Learn about LabVIEW’s front panel, block diagram, and palettes
- Perform arithmetic and logical operations using LabVIEW
- Implement modular programming using subVIs
- Apply loops and shift registers for iterative computations
- Perform array operations
- Work with clusters and graphical display elements
- Implement string handling and file I/O operations
- Use programming structures effectively
- Apply IMAQ and Vision Toolbox concepts
- Work with Control and Simulation Toolbox
