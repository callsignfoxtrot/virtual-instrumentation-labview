Q1. Develop a VI to convert minutes into hours and seconds. 
    m = 60              s = 3600
                        h = 1
    m = 30              s = 1800
                        h=0.5

Q2. Create a VI to perform:   y = √2 * b + a^3 + log10(a * b) using functions and a formula node.
    a = 2                y = 5.24
    b = 5

    a = 3                y = 7.00
    b = 4



Q3. Implement the Boolean logic: Y = (A' + (B ⊕ C))' · (D + B') and verify using a truth table.
    A = 1               Y = 1
    B = 0
    C = 0
    D = 1

    A = 0               Y = 0
    B = 1
    C = 1
    D = 1



Q4. Build a VI to calculate parking charges based on duration of parking with separate time-based tariff structures for:
   - Two-wheelers (off)
   - Four-wheelers(on)
   Use a toggle switch to select the vehicle type.

    toggle: off          charge = 300
    time = 3

    toggle: on           charge = 400
    time = 2

Q5. Create a VI to find the magnitude and phase angle of a complex number.
    complex number = 3+4i       
    magnitude = 5
    phase angle = 53.1201

    complex number = 16+9i       
    magnitude = 18.3576
    phase angle = 29.3578
